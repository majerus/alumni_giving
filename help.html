All data in this motion graphic is presented 'as-is' from IPEDS.  Due to these data being self-reported by each institution, the quality of the data in this visualization is only as high as the quality of institutional reporting. IPEDS data is reported yearly. This graphic will be uploaded when new data is made available. All IPEDS data is displayed as year-end data (i.e. 2013 is 2012-13). The following variable definitions come directly from <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/" target="_blank">IPEDS</a>. Select a variable from the list below to see the IPEDS definition.
