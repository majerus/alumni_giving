Term endowment funds are funds which the donor has stipulated that the principal may be expended after a stated period or on the occurrence of a certain event. Funds functioning as endowment (quasi-endowment funds) are established by the governing board to function like an endowment fund but which may be totally expended at any time at the discretion of the governing board. These funds represent nonmandatory transfers from the current fund rather than a direct addition to the endowment fund, as occurs for the true endowment categories. The full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment used is the sum of the institution FTE undergraduate enrollment and FTE graduate enrollment (as calculated from or reported on the 12-month Enrollment component) plus the estimated FTE of first-professional students.
